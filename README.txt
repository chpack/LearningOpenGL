This is a little project for me to learn OpenGL. I'm learning OpenGL from 
www.learnopengl.com and the translation of Chinese, learnopengl-cn.github.io.

And this little game is build on ArchLinux x64, and I didn't tried on other os.


Because some reason, I haven't updata this for about 3 mounths. So, I have to rebuild
this.
